    "[KMeans clustering](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-6a6e67336aa1) has been one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning models for exploring latent trends in datasets. We explored this approach with the assumption that clustering would shed light on underlying patterns of tracks regarding 1) how they are similar (either within, or outside of the scheme of genres), and 2) how they are grouped together into playlists by users. Specifically, we explored this centroid-base algorithm on audio features. In short, the clustering process groups tracks by minimizing their differences by audio features, with respect to the number of centroids defined.  "

    "For consistency and comparative purpose of the current project, we defined evaluation and prediction for models before the models were built. Regardless of the size of dataset at the stage of exploration, we train-test split our dataset so that 20% of each playlist were put aside as the test set. Within training, 20% of each playlist were put aside for validation. For clustering prediction, the test set was only used in final step after model tuning. Our models were evaluted using R-Precision, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)."

Before we start filling out the prediction list based on cluster similarities, we ranked artists based on their occurance in the training data for each individual playlist. Specifically, we predicted songs for artists that appeared 3 times or more, with the most popular ones first. If the prediction list is not then filled, we moved onto the original clustering prediction procedure. This model was directedly tested on test sets for final report. However, for demonstration purpose, we output the prediction on validation set below, with respect to the same example dataset. "

    "Comparisons between models suggested that our final model improved considerably on performance. However, it is important to note that our final model is essentially a hybrid of artist-based prediction and cluster-based prediction model. It is possible that some prediction process was never moved onto the cluster-based stage. Therefore, it is important to further investigate the effectiveness of each step of our final model. In addition, our current project only investigated K-Means clustering, a centroid-based algorithm; in the future, we can explore other clustering algorithms such as density-based DBSCAN to compare model performance. Future work should also investigate clustering with artist features, and even lyrics features. We posit that clustering with audio features would be maximize when we have a large dataset, however, there would be a limit posed by the limitation in audio features to capture uniqueness and characteristics of tracks."
